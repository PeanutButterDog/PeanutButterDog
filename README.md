- 👋 Hi, I’m @PeanutButterDog
- 👀 I’m interested in lots of things...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Microsoft Azure...
- 💞️ I’m looking to potentially collaborate on things when I understand a bit more about all this...
- 📫 How to reach me - If you need to you already know how...
- 😄 Pronouns: Call me what you want and I'll call you what I want, if either of us takes offence then we can change the labels at that point...
- ⚡ Fun fact: Fun is subjective...
